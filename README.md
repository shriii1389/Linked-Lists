# Linked-Lists
Basic codes for singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular lists
There is also one ordered linked lists
The file named 'singlylinkedlists1.c' uses global variables and 'singlylinkedlist2.c' uses local ones. 
I used globally for the first one cause it's simpler to understand if you are a beginner and it shortens the code.
Hope this code helps!
